Today I have the pleasure to release Routex v1.0.0, after a year of testing and improvements.
It now has a list of first-party [packages](/docs/packages/index) for common uses, such as a body-parser, cookies, and hooks (to be talked in another article!)

[Read move at DEV](https://dev.to/cretezy/routex-v1-0-0-modern-node-router-gch)

Don't wait up and [get started](/docs/introduction)!
