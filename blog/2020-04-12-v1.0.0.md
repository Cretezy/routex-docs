Today I have the pleasure to release Routex v1.0.0, after a year of testing and improvements.
It now has a list of first-party [packages](../docs/packages/index.md) for common uses, such as a body-parser, cookies, and hooks (to be talked in another article!)

Don't wait up and [get started](../docs/introduction.md)!
